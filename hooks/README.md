## Examples For Different Use Cases

We have many different examples revolving around different use cases. They are as follows:

### General Capability Change Test Cases

   * `index.js` - This Test is an example of all the **advanced funtionalities** possible with Smart UI.
  
      ```
      npm start
      ```
   * `general.js` - This Test is an example of all the **general test**
   
        ```
        npm start general
        ```
       
   * `errorSetting.js` - This Test is an example of how **error settings** can be modified.
   
      ```
      npm start error
      ```
      
   * `transparency.js` - This Test is to show how to **alter the opacity** of the comparison screenshot.
   
      ```
      npm start transparency
      ```
      
   * `BoundingBoxes.js` - This Test shows an example of comparing only a **certain area** in the screenshot.
   
      ```
      npm start boundingBoxes
      ```
      
   * `ignoredBoxes.js` - This test is for **excluding certain areas** in the screenshot for comparison.
   
      ```
      npm start ignoredBoxes
      ```
      
   * `ignoreAreasColoredWith.js` - This test is for **removing the colored content** from the comparison.
   
      ```
      npm start ignoreAreasColoredWith
      ```

### Execute Tests on Multiple URLs

To get started, first configure the `url.json` with the help of the code given below.

```bash
[
    {
        "screenshotName": "Lambdatest Landing Page",
        "url": "https://lambdatest.com"
    },
    {
        "screenshotName": "Amazon Home Page",
        "url": "https://amazon.com"
    }
]
```

Run the following command to execute tests on multiple URLs.

```bash
npm run multiple
```

Given below is the multiple URL tests sample.

```bash
const webdriver = require("selenium-webdriver");
const By = webdriver.By;
const moment = require("moment");
const automationConfig = require("./config.json");
const smartUITests = require("./urls.json");

// username: Username can be found at automation dashboard
const USERNAME = process.env.LT_USERNAME || "<Your_Username>";

// AccessKey:  AccessKey can be generated from automation dashboard or profile section
const KEY = process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY || "<Your_Access_key>";

//connect to Lambdatest hub
const GRID_HOST = process.env.GRID_HOST || "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";

const gridUrl = "https://" + USERNAME + ":" + KEY + GRID_HOST;

// Selenium WebDriver Function

async function runSmartUIonLambdatest() {
  // Lambdatest Cloud Selenium Grid Connection

  // Printing the Lambdatest Cloud Information for the test

  console.log(
    "Please visit https://smartui.lambdatest.com to see your SmartUI - Visual Regression Tests"
  );

  try {
    automationConfig.forEach(async (...config) => {
      const driver = await new webdriver.Builder()
        .usingServer(gridUrl)
        .withCapabilities(...config)
        .build();
      try {
        smartUITests.forEach((smartUITest) => {
          let smartUI_ScreenshotName = smartUITest.screenshotName;
          let smartUI_url = smartUITest.url;
          smartUISeleniumTest(driver, smartUI_url, smartUI_ScreenshotName);
        });
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
      // Closing the Browser Session
      await driver.executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
      await driver.quit();
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(err));
    await driver.executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
  }
}

async function smartUISeleniumTest(driver, url, screenshotName) {
  await driver
    .get(url)
    .then(() => {
      // For Smartui TakeScreenshot
      console.log(
        `Capturing the Screenshot Name:  ${screenshotName} | URL: ${url}`
      );
      driver.manage().setTimeouts({ implicit: 10000 });
      let images = driver.findElements(webdriver.By.css("img.lazyload"));
      for (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {
        driver.executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView();", images[i]);
        driver.wait(until.elementIsVisible(images[i]), 10000); // wait up to 10 seconds for image to appear

        let src = images[i].getAttribute("src");
        console.log(`Captured image source: ${src}`);
      }
      driver
        .executeScript(`smartui.takeFullPageScreenshot=${screenshotName}`)
        .then((result) => {
          console.log("Result :", result);
        });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
    });
}

// Executing the tests in parallel of multiple urls
runSmartUIonLambdatest();
```


      
### Execute Tests on Multiple Resolutions

If you want to execute Visual Regression tests on multiple resolutions, you need to add the capability `resolution` in capabilities option.
```
  let capabilities = {
      ...
      resolution = "1920x1080";
      ...
  }
```
Few common resolutions are:
- 1024x768
- 1280x800
- 1600x1200
- 1920x1080
- 2560x1440

Here is the code for all the commonly used resolutions:

#### Run Test on `1024x768` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1024x768
```

#### Run Test on `1280x800` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1280x800
```

#### Run Test on `1600x1200` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1600x1200
```


#### Run Test on `1920x1080` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 1920x1080
```


#### Run Test on `2560x1440` resolution 
```
$ node custom-resolutions.js 2560x1440
```

## Setting Up Github App Integration with SmartUI

### Steps 1: Integrate the your Lambdatest Account with GitHub App. 

You can integrate your LambdaTest account with the GiHub application in the following ways:

- Using OAuth

![github-app-landing-92ef6e152a7302cb9ab88f5034b9ec0c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126776938/232715867-f375b4df-1bc9-4e88-8340-44e986be2e9a.png)


### Step 2: Select your GitHub repository 

Go to your GitHub repository where you want to configure your SmartUI project. Check out our GitHub sample [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/smartui-node-sample).

### Step 3: Configure your test suite

Add the `Github` capability to your current test configuration:

```bash
const capabilities: {
  platform: "Windows 10",
  browserName: "chrome",
  version: "latest",
  "smartUI.project": "Smart UI sample test",
   github: {
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/commitId", // Mandatory
    "owner": "{OWNER}",  //Optional
    "repo": "{REPO}",  //Optional
    "commit": "{commitId}" //Optional
   }
}
```

### Step 4: Setting up your CI configuration

Setting up your CI workflow to execute on GitHub. Here is an example setup with `GitHub Actions`:

Go to `.github/workflows/<your_ci_file>.yml`.

```bash
    name: Execute SmartUI Test with Github App Integration
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: Create commit status
      run: |
        API_HOST=https://api.github.com
        # Check out the PR branch
        git checkout $GITHUB_HEAD_REF
        # Get the commit ID of the last commit
        COMMIT_ID=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
        echo "Last commit ID of PR: $COMMIT_ID"
        GITHUB_URL=$API_HOST/repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/statuses/$COMMIT_ID
        echo "GITHUB_URL: $GITHUB_URL"
        echo "GITHUB_URL=$GITHUB_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### Step5: Execute your test suite with CI

After the setup is completed, you can now execute your test suite with the Continuos Integration (CI) pipeline with any tool of your choice.

**Please Note:** *On running the tests with this repository the user should be able to trigger the `GitHub Action` and execute the `SmartUI` tests for `Selenium`, `Cypress and CDP` frameworks excluding `StoryBook`.* 

### Step 6: Commit you changes over git on a branch and raise the PR to main branch.

### Step 7: Now you will see the `lambdatest-smartui-app` in the PR.
